On Unix, C extensions are no longer linked to libpython except on Android.

It is now possible for a statically linked Python to load a C extension built
using a shared library Python.

When Python is embedded, ``libpython`` must not be loaded with ``RTLD_LOCAL``,
but ``RTLD_GLOBAL`` instead. Previously, using ``RTLD_LOCAL``, it was already
not possible to load C extensions which were not linked to ``libpython``, such
as C extensions of the standard library built by the ``*shared*`` section of
``Modules/Setup``.

distutils, python-config and python-config.py have been modified.
