Deprecated passing required arguments like *func* as keyword arguments
in functions which should accept arbitrary keyword arguments and pass them
to other function. Arbitrary keyword arguments (even with names "self" and
"func") can now be passed to these functions if the required arguments are
passed as positional arguments.
